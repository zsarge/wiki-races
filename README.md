# wiki-races

This is a complete rewrite of my wiki races game, based on what
I wish I did for my first design.

> First Design: https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/WikiRaces2021

Given that this project uses Go and Vuejs, it's a little less
beginner friendly than the last version, which used only Javascript.

Todo:

- add page viewer
- Cache files
- Add pin number for letting people into games
- add leaderboard
